The real question facing healthcare executives is not if they are going to implement AI but how.\n\nNow’s the time to think beyond clinical applications, given the turnover and revenue trends for the healthcare industry. Generative AI can play an instantly impactful, pivotal role in non-clinical aspects of healthcare, streamlining administrative tasks, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing overall healthcare management. And this technology can be implemented quickly, with deep integration for faster bottom line results.\n\nNon-clinical operations are the perfect area for a first step because there is a lot of low-hanging fruit that can be picked with technology that exists today. There are, however, a few important considerations.\n\n### What does Generative AI do? And is it like a chatbot?\n\nGenerative, conversational AI is far more advanced than your basic chatbot. It’s a mode of advanced artificial intelligence that can generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, or other types of data.\n\nSo if you’re speaking or having a conversation with generative AI, the AI can reply specifically to your question or statement, customizing its responses to feel human and be accurate to your situation. This is especially helpful for patient management which as we know can be sensitive and singular, from when they set up a first appointment to when they work with the billing department.\n\n### What non-clinical operations does Generative AI automate exactly?\n\nAI-driven solutions, like generative or conversational AI, can automate:\n\n- Patient conversations via email, text, phone, or chat (That’s right, Good AI should be able to talk on the phone.)\n- Scheduling and rescheduling all appointments, including when a patient needs to meet with a specific doctor based on their speciality, availability, and more.\n- Billing communication, translating jargon to plain speak.\n- Record-keeping, tracking and using predictive analytics to optimize resource utilization and efficient operations.\n\nAI assistants improve patient communication, offering support and information. Population health management benefits from AI's ability to analyze large datasets, identifying trends for preventive interventions. Taken together, AI is proving indispensable in transforming healthcare delivery, making processes more agile, cost-effective, and patient-centric.\n\n### How does this solve poor patient experience?\n\nThe state of the healthcare industry is challenging right now to say the least, with slim teams and high patient demand. Plus the modern patient views hospital service as part of a consumer experience.\n\n53% of online healthcare complaints were about poor communications, particularly phone communications, followed by 35% of complaints about long wait times and a call-abandonment rate of 22.6% overall from one reported provider demonstrates that inefficient operations are the key driver of dissatisfaction.\n\nMeanwhile, the inability to communicate with patients consistently is costing us. Missed appointments alone cost the U.S. healthcare system $[150B](https://www.hfma.org/finance-and-business-strategy/how-cfos-can-bring-the-rigor-of-finance-to-the-call-center/) each year. While the majority of patients prefer to communicate via phone and text, these methods of outreach are either disorganized or underutilized. This equates to a significant loss in revenue with lower patient acquisition, missed appointments, and time wasted on the clinical and non-clinical side. Call center costs have continued to climb for healthcare organizations as they try to handle increased volumes by employing human agents. But call centers can’t truly scale but only grow linearly with volume.\n\nEnter AI as the solution: AI-driven tools reduce the need for human operators and admin with high conversational capabilities and consistent automated messaging. This efficiency not only cuts operational expenses but also enhances customer service with 24/7 availability and quick response times.\n\nBy handling routine tasks such as appointment scheduling and refilling patient prescriptions, conversational AI assistants can free up human agents and your hospital admin to focus their resources on more complex and meaningful interactions that directly impact the business, leading to reduced burnout and increased job satisfaction.\n\n### Okay, where do I start?\n\nNon-clinical operations are really the perfect area for a first step into automation because there is a lot of low-hanging fruit that can be picked with technology that exists today. There are, however, a few important considerations.\n\nAI is advanced technology that requires specialized knowledge and expertise in order to build an effective product. Executives shouldn’t work with a service provider for whom AI is simply a hobby or one product among many. They need real expertise. In order to make a smooth transition, executives need to bring together all of the correct stakeholders across patient access, operations, technology, compliance, and more in order to manage.\n\nEmbracing AI in non-clinical realms demonstrates its potential to make healthcare more agile, cost-effective, and patient-centric. As the healthcare industry integrates AI, executives should prioritize non-clinical operations, navigating implementation challenges, fostering collaboration among stakeholders, and seeking specialized expertise to harness AI's capabilities effectively. The question is not whether to adopt AI but how to strategically leverage its power to revolutionize non-clinical aspects and improve healthcare delivery and management.\n\n### Meet us at VIVE 2024, Booth #2243"
