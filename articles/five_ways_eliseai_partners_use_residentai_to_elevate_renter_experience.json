    "main_content": "# Five Ways EliseAI Partners Use ResidentAI To Elevate Renter Experience\n\nAt EliseAI, our commitment to innovation has consistently positioned us at the vanguard of technological advancements. Our newest addition is no exception: Elise ResidentAI demonstrates our ambition to create a future where automation is intrinsic to every facet of the renter experience.\n\nResidents have unique needs: Requests about amenities, payments, work orders, events, and more start even before move-in, and continue throughout their lease. How and when they get responses and receive attention can directly impact retention and satisfaction, shaping your property and business reputation permanently. Not to mention, resident standards have changed, with more renters wanting personalized and exceptional services from an accessible onsite team.\n\nImplementing ResidentAI to handle all aspects of the resident lifecycle has a major pay-off, for both your residents and over-tasked teams. Here’s how EliseAI partners have implemented ResidentAI to reduce costs and effort and create long-term value at their properties.\n\n## Four Ways That Industry Leaders Have Implemented ResidentAI\n\n1. **Going Mobile**  \n   40% of property managers text directly with renters — which begs the question: Do 40% of property managers really have the time to be texting renters directly? Considering the renter preference is to text, you can’t expect your team to be on their phone or reply right away.  \n   ResidentAI automates text, email, and voice conversations with your renters, with humanlike responses in just minutes. We’ve also seen most residents prefer to engage with ResidentAI via text after-hours.\n\n2. **Providing 24/7 On-Demand Access**  \n   EliseAI partners want to bridge the customer service gap between industries like hospitality and housing. The expectation of renters in luxury or Class A assets, is high, with personalized attention, amenities, and onsite teams setting the community apart. By using an AI Resident Assistant to provide concierge services and respond 24/7, even after hours, renters experience a level of attention that improves resident satisfaction and property reputation.  \n   Our partner Travis Block, VP of Marketing at Radco Residential, knows the value of having AI available to work with residents, especially in cities with rapidly growing renter populations. “Being able to use AI to create that on-demand experience for prospective renters and residents really sets us apart in dense luxury markets.”\n\n3. **Automating Resident Services Like Maintenance**  \n   Without AI or resident portals, residents:  \n   - Have to play the waiting game, wondering when their work order will be fulfilled.  \n   - Don’t have a point of contact to ask routine maintenance or follow-up questions  \n   - Can’t get any advice on how to fix the issue on their own  \n   - Can’t figure out who to contact in case of an emergency  \n   With AI-managed maintenance conversations and work order fulfillment, ResidentAI texts residents, reminding them that they can submit a work order any time simply through a text message.  \n   When [submitting a work order with ResidentAI](https://www.eliseai.com/residentai), renters:  \n   - Get advice on how to make quick fixes on their own  \n   - Get confirmation of a work order submitted  \n   - Ask follow-up questions and get updates on when their work order will be completed  \n   - Grant permission to enter their unit  \n   - Get confirmation of the work order being completed  \n   - Provide feedback at any time.\n\n4. **Reducing Delinquencies & Making Payments Easy**  \n   Efficiency in payment processes is central to resident satisfaction and to [reducing delinquencies](https://www.eliseai.com/residentai), which in turn improves operational capabilities.  \n   While plenty of operators are investing in online portals to submit rental payments, these portals can only handle payment processing and reminders. Dealing with late payments or payment questions is still a time-consuming challenge.  \n   ResidentAI is there to handle all payment aspects. Texting residents before and after payment due dates to remind them to pay, letting them know about late fees and helping them make partial payments as well including any questions they may have.  \n   Not only does this produce more on-time payments, but it also means your team doesn’t have to manually text or call renters for payments.\n\n5. **Cultivating Positive Community Experiences**  \n   Property managers can enhance the living experience for renters by creating spaces that foster connection and collaboration. With [more gen z and millennial renters renting longer than previous generations](https://money.com/millennials-rent-forever-never-own-home/), they’re seeking more neighborly interactions.  \n   Hosting regular community events, such as social gatherings, workshops, and fitness classes, can provide opportunities for residents to interact, build relationships, and forge a sense of belonging. It’s essential for property managers to leverage technology for communication and event coordination with residents. Onsite teams can send routine event updates and reminders to advertise new community upgrades, news, and events through EliseCRM.  \n   Recognizing the importance of cultivating positive community experiences is not merely a trend but a strategic move for modern property management. In an era where the rental market is highly competitive, the quality of resident experiences plays a pivotal role in tenant retention. By investing in community-building initiatives, property managers not only improve the overall satisfaction of their residents but also create a unique selling proposition for their properties.\n\nEliseAI's ResidentAI is not just a technological leap forward; it's a strategic investment in revolutionizing the renter experience. By addressing the unique needs of residents and streamlining communication through automation, EliseAI partners are not only elevating satisfaction levels but also securing long-term value for their properties. From providing 24/7 on-demand access to automating resident services like maintenance requests, and reducing delinquencies, ResidentAI is reshaping the landscape of property management. The commitment to cultivating positive community experiences further cements EliseAI's dedication to creating a future where automation seamlessly integrates into every aspect of the renter journey."
