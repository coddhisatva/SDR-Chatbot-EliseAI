It enhances operational efficiency by increasing tour availability, reducing staffing costs, and automating routine tasks like follow-ups, ID verification, and application management. Seamlessly integrated with CRM & PMS systems, AIGT transforms the leasing process into a streamlined and efficient journey that benefits both renters and property teams.\n\n“AI-Guided Tours are setting a new standard in property management,” said Ian Weng, SVP of Strategy at EliseAI. “With AIGT, leasing teams can provide an exceptional touring experience while optimizing their operations and meeting the demands of today’s renters.”\n\nWith AI-Guided Tours, EliseAI continues its mission of creating innovative, AI-powered solutions that empower property management teams and enhance the renter experience.
