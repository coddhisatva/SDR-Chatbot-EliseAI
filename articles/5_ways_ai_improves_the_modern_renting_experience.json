    "main_content": "# 5 Ways AI Improves the Modern Renting Experience\n\nThe modern renting experience hasn’t caught up with the [responsive, personalized consumer experiences we’ve grown used to in other industries.](https://www.eliseai.com/blog/the-uberfication-of-customer-expectations) This isn’t for lack of trying by property management operators, but rather a result of technological shortcomings, heightened customer expectations, and limited availability of desirable homes in popular markets. However, there is one transformative technology that is completely changing the way people find and rent apartments—AI. Today, we’ll dive into 5 renter-focused ways that AI has improved the renter journey, illustrated by real conversations between AI and renters.\n\n## AI Helps Limited English Proficiency Individuals Find Homes with Automatic Translation\n\nFor people with limited English proficiency (LEP), overcoming a language barrier can be one of the biggest challenges when trying to find a new home. While the [Fair Housing Act protects limited English proficiency individuals](https://www.nhlp.org/initiatives/fair-housing-housing-for-people-with-disabilities/language-access/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20the%20Fair%20Housing%20Act,origin%20discrimination%20under%20the%20FHA.) from being explicitly discriminated against during the housing rental process, finding communities with onsite teams that speak and provide all the necessary documentation in their preferred language can still be difficult. And with [8% of the US population over the age of 5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6071899/#:~:text=Introduction,2) falling into the limited English proficiency category (a figure that has grown 80% since 1990), it’s more crucial than ever to have tools and technology in place to better serve these renters and ensure an inclusive leasing process.\n\nFortunately, AI technology offers real-time translation capabilities that enable LEP individuals to search for housing in their preferred language. For example, EliseAI’s products support written communication over email and text message in **51 languages**, including Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, Arabic, French, and more. Prospects are often deeply grateful when they are communicated with in their preferred language, as it makes them feel valued, understood, and more confident in navigating the leasing process.\n\nIf real-time written translation isn’t impressive enough, EliseAI’s VoiceAI takes it a step further, enabling spoken communication over the phone including English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Polish, and Portuguese.

These renters are left with difficult choices: either taking paid time off work to tour an apartment, applying for an apartment sight unseen, or doing exhausting research to find a leasing office that accommodates their work schedule.\n\nAI bridges that gap by providing seamless and secure touring options that allow prospects to tour apartments during off-hours when the leasing office is closed. This “best of both worlds” approach enables you to capture demand when your staff is off the clock while simultaneously providing prospective renters much needed flexibility to find their next home on their own schedule.\n\nEliseAI’s AI-Guided Tours reinvents the leasing experience by leveraging conversational AI technology to provide real-time community and unit-specific information to prospects during their self-guided tour over the phone or text. EliseAI guides prospects through their tours, from check-in, key collection and credit card verification, to answering detailed questions about the units they’re viewing, ensuring they get the same quality tour they would receive with a member of the leasing team. The feedback from prospective renters has been fantastic: here’s what they have to say about EliseAI’s AI-Guided Tours.\n\n## Renters Get Quicker Responses from AI\n\nModern renters, shaped by a culture of [“always-on” customer service](https://www.eliseai.com/blog/the-uberfication-of-customer-expectations) from lightning fast direct-to-consumer applications like Uber, DoorDash, and Amazon Prime, now bring those same expectations of speed, convenience, and responsiveness to the renting process. However, EliseAI’s mystery shopping data reveals that [over 30% of calls to leasing offices during working hours](https://www.eliseai.com/mystery-shop) go unanswered, highlighting the gap between the “always-on” expectations of the modern renter and the reality of current leasing office operations.\n\nOne of the most significant positive impacts AI has on the modern renting experience is the increased responsiveness it brings by managing the bulk of inbound and outbound communications. Instead of relying on overworked leasing agents to manage hundreds of follow-ups and respond to prospect inquiries, AI steps in to manage all communications, typically responding in 5 minutes or less, making it easier than ever for renters to get answers to questions and move through the leasing funnel. It’s a win-win—prospects receive faster service while leasing agents are freed up to manage high-value tasks like in-person tours and application management. The results speak for themselves, with one happy prospect telling Elise that it’s the “best communicator of all the buildings and agents” they spoke to.\n\n## AI Improves Consistency and Fairness from Renter to Renter\n\nLack of transparency and consistency in renter communications poses challenges for both renters and multifamily operators. With the US Government making a concerted effort to increase fee transparency and reduce hidden costs, inconsistencies in quoting fees, communicating application outcomes, or explaining the criteria used in the leasing process can create significant issues. For renters, consistent and transparent communication with the leasing team is a crucial part of ensuring the rental process is equitable and fair.\n\nUtilizing AI to manage communications makes the rental process more transparent and consistent for renters. AI doesn’t deviate from established guidelines, create unexpected fees, or mistakenly misquote prices for services. AI will always communicate with prospects and residents accurate, up-to-date information in the property management system, without human error. This includes providing renters with advanced notice about scheduled automatic payments, proactively communicating any changes or discrepancies in charges, and, with EliseAI’s Lease Auditing feature, ensuring that ledger items align exactly with what your residents are billed. Prospects and residents appreciate the transparency and consistency of dealing with AI, as reflected in their positive feedback during conversations.\n\n## AI Talks to Renters Where They Want to Chat\n\nAs we move into the mid-2020s, consumer communication preferences are evolving rapidly. Another major component of this shift is the move away from calling and emailing as primary methods of communication, with an increased focus on texting and other short form chatting platforms. While this trend is partly demographic driven, as younger generations increasingly prefer texting over calling, it reflects a broader change in how residents and prospects want to communicate. In fact, 79% of renters in a recent survey stated that they should be able to [“get everything they need through direct message, text, or chat.”](https://www.multifamilyexecutive.com/property-management/demographics/79-of-renters-want-to-communicate-with-property-managers-via-text-or-chat_o) For renters looking for new homes, being required to follow-up with leasing offices via email or phone call can be a dealbreaker, underscoring the importance of meeting renters where they are.\n\nConversational AI solutions like EliseAI empower the modern renter by engaging with them on their preferred communication channel, including texting, webchat, or on a call. For the 79% of renters who think they should be able to complete the entire rental process from their smartphone with a few text messages, AI turns that vision into reality. And for older demographics that prefer phone calls, [VoiceAI](https://www.eliseai.com/resources/voiceai) talks like your best agent while still leveraging automated workflows that reduce work for your onsite team. The impact is clear from real feedback, with renters expressing appreciation for the convenience, responsiveness, and ease of communication that EliseAI provides.\n\n## Improving Your Renters’ Journeys with AI\n\nAI brings significant benefits to the experience all renters have. With faster response times, expanded touring hours, real-time translation capabilities, omnichannel messaging, and transparent and consistent communications, AI enhances the entire renter journey and improves access to housing. Renters can find homes faster, communicate on the platforms they prefer, and ensure they’re being treated fairly throughout the process.
