From automating resident communication to providing [increased visibility into the efficacy of marketing efforts](https://www.eliseai.com/blog/reshaping-property-marketing-with-ai-and-automation), AI-powered tools like ChatGPT are helping property managers, leasing teams, and marketing professionals work more efficiently by automating high-volume, low-value tasks. But while almost everyone has heard of ChatGPT by now, many multifamily leaders are still unsure of the best way to transition generative AI tools from “novelty” to “need to have” in their tech stacks. Fortunately, EliseAI is here to help demystify AI for the multifamily industry.\n\nIn our most recent webinar, “Introduction to ChatGPT for Multifamily Leaders,” Evan Lee, Strategy and Business Operations Manager at EliseAI, walked through the fundamentals of ChatGPT, broke down some top multifamily use cases and shared practical strategies for maximizing the impact of generative AI tools. Here are key takeaways from the session, including actionable ways to use ChatGPT to save time, increase operational consistency, and enhance efficiency across both onsite and corporate teams. Let’s dive in.\n\n## The Fundamentals of ChatGPT for Multifamily: What You Need to Know\nAt its core, ChatGPT is a powerful AI model that generates human-like text in response to user prompts. The technology behind it, called a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (or GPT), allows the AI to recognize patterns in language and produce relevant, contextual responses. While most ChatGPT users leverage it for simple tasks like answering questions or drafting emails, they’re only scratching the surface of the potential uses of generative AI.\n\nUnderstanding how ChatGPT processes prompts, or user instructions, and tokens, or the units of text it analyzes, is critical for optimizing its output. A vague prompt will yield a generic response, while a specific, well-structured prompt can generate tailored, high-quality content. For multifamily professionals, this means both learning how to specifically ask ChatGPT the right questions, and what context you need to provide in order to get the best possible outputs.\n\n## How Multifamily Leaders Can Use ChatGPT to Work Smarter, Not Harder\nMultifamily professionals juggle a high volume of tasks every day. ChatGPT can help lighten the load by automating routine, low-value tasks, while also accelerating content generation. Here are four key use cases:\n- **Generating Documents & Text:** Draft property listings, SOPs, marketing emails, and more while maintaining brand voice.\n- **Brainstorming & Idea Generation:** Quickly generate creative event ideas and marketing strategies.\n- **Data Analysis & Research:** Upload spreadsheets to extract actionable insights and analyze trends.\n- **Automating Manual Workflows:** Use tools like OpenAI’s Operator model to reduce time spent on low-value tasks.\n\n## ChatGPT’s Advanced Features: Going Beyond Basic Chat\nOpenAI is continually developing new tools that have applications for the multifamily industry, such as:\n- **Canvas:** A document-editing tool for refining text with in-line suggestions.\n- **Projects:** A workspace for organizing large-scale initiatives.\n- **Deep Research:** A tool for building comprehensive reports by synthesizing information from the internet.\n- **Operator:** An automation agent that executes web-based tasks on behalf of the user.\n\nBy leveraging these advanced features, multifamily leaders can use AI as an operational force-multiplying tool that enables better decisions and faster workflows.\n\n## Prompting Best Practices: How to Get the Best Responses from ChatGPT for Multifamily\nEffective prompting is key to getting valuable responses. Here are four techniques to improve ChatGPT responses:\n- **Role-Based Prompting:** Ask ChatGPT to respond as a specific stakeholder for more relevant answers.\n- **Few-Shot Learning:** Provide examples to guide ChatGPT’s output.\n- **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Request a detailed breakdown of the AI’s thought process.\n- **Format Enforcement:** Direct ChatGPT to structure responses in specific formats.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, multifamily leaders can ensure they receive the most valuable and relevant responses from ChatGPT.\n\n## ChatGPT for Multifamily vs. Conversational AI: What’s the Difference?\nWhile ChatGPT is a powerful tool, it does not integrate with property management software (PMS) or CRM systems. For actual resident and leasing conversations, multifamily teams should seek purpose-built AI solutions like EliseAI’s products.\n\n## Improving Operational Efficiency with AI and Automation\nUsing ChatGPT is a great start for multifamily teams looking to automate tedious communications and tasks. At EliseAI, we’re building advanced conversational AI designed for the multifamily industry, enabling teams to focus on high-value work."
