    "main_content": "# How the EliseAI Customer Success Team Elevates Client Operations\n\nThe difference between a successful deployment of new multifamily technology and a failed one doesn’t always come down to the quality of the product. One key make or break factor for any new tool lies in the hands of the support and enablement that the owner or manager receives during the course of the rollout. The best technology in the world can still fall flat on its face without high quality, outcome-oriented assistance from the vendor—something many multifamily veterans are all too familiar with.\n\nAt EliseAI, we know how powerful AI and automation can be when implemented to transform conventional property management operations. But we also know that implementing cutting edge tech requires extensive change management, and that adopting this new way of working necessitates a hands-on approach. That’s why EliseAI prides itself on offering differentiated levels of customer success management and support, enabling multifamily operators to quickly recognize value on their AI spend while avoiding the pitfalls of failed tech rollouts. Today we’ll pull back the curtain on the day to day operations of our Customer Success (CS) team, highlighting how they’ve driven successful AI outcomes for over 415 owners and operators through collaboration, product expertise, and technical proficiency.\n\n## The Role of the Customer Success Team\nThe Customer Success team at EliseAI serves as a bridge between the hundreds of operators who depend on EliseAI’s suite of solutions and our engineers, with support from a dedicated Strategy and Operations team. For [Jason Yunakov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonyunakov/), a veteran Senior Customer Success Manager here at EliseAI, the CS team’s proximity to Engineering makes all the difference when it comes to “not only addressing immediate client needs but also identifying opportunities for product improvements that drive long-term operational success.” The CS team’s high level of technical skill, with both former software engineers and implementation specialists on the team, enables them to effectively troubleshoot even the most complex issues with our AI and automated workflows.\n\nThe members of the EliseAI CS team also bring the insights they glean from interactions with operators both large and small back to the Engineering team, ensuring that our customers get the features and functionality they need to deliver positive outcomes onsite. Through translating complex, real-world problems into actionable insights, the CS team ensures our customers directly inform product development, looping in specialized engineers and proactively surfacing unique use cases of our [AI solutions](https://www.eliseai.com/blog/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-ai-agent) that merit specific features or solutions.\n\n## Staying Ahead of the Curve with CS Support\nBeyond serving as the connective tissue between EliseAI’s Engineering team and our customers, the CS team closely monitors client performance with automation tools and predictive health indicators. This allows our customer success managers (CSMs) to devote more time and resources to clients’ needs, and allows them to proactively flag any potential disruptions or issues to be resolved. The Customer Success team undergoes constant training and upskilling on both customer success best practices and new functionality of our AI and automation solutions, helping keep them ahead of the curve when it comes to resolving client issues. By receiving real-time training on any product or feature updates, our CS team ensures that our clients always receive the most relevant, up-to-date support possible and understand exactly what to expect when new tools launch.\n\nThe CS team’s proximity to the unique business cases of each of our clients also enables them to proactively recommend tailored solutions based on each client’s operational goals. As our partnerships with operators around the country continue to develop and flourish, having dedicated CS team members on each account ensures that the client’s ongoing operational needs are explored and strategically mapped to EliseAI’s products. The end goal for our CS team is always to uncover opportunities for further efficiency gains for our clients, allowing them to [drive ROI on their AI expenditures](https://www.eliseai.com/blog/reshaping-property-marketing-with-ai-and-automation) while delivering both improved financial results and better customer experiences for residents and prospects.\n\n## Unlocking the Power of Collaboration\nEliseAI’s culture of collaboration, where Customer Success and Engineering work hand-in-hand, ensures that all members of our team regularly speak with customers to understand their unique business goals and needs. This laser focus on the unique needs of each of our clients ensures the solutions we build directly map to the real-world pain points that owners and managers face. What does this collaboration look like in practice? Faster feature rollouts, better targeting of future solution development, and seamless integration of client feedback directly into our products.\n\nFor [Patrick Mickelson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickmickelson/), Senior Customer Success Manager here at EliseAI, it’s this focus on collaboration that differentiates EliseAI from other multifamily vendors. In Patrick’s eyes, EliseAI “sees itself as a true partner to our clients, dedicated to understanding their business from top to bottom. This collaboration not only helps us identify solutions to immediate challenges but also uncovers opportunities to automate their workflows and improve outcomes.” Our ethos, according to Patrick, goes beyond just checking boxes and delivering standardized QBRs. Instead, our CS team’s approach “combines curiosity, a deep understanding of client needs, and technical expertise to create solutions that drive long-term success.”\n\nThis collaborative approach is reflected in the development of our product suite. EliseAI prioritizes building new solutions alongside clients to ensure that the features and functionality of our new AI and automation tools actually meet the needs of managers and owners. As showcased by our work with [the Scion Group](https://www.eliseai.com/resources/how-the-scion-group-reinvented-their-leasing-process-with-conversational-ai), co-developing new products like [Sidekick](https://support.meetelise.com/hc/en-us/articles/30569622849677-Elise-Sidekick), mass messaging tools, and [student housing-specific](https://www.eliseai.com/asset/student) features like guarantor follow ups ensure that our solutions directly map to the actual pain points faced by property management companies.\n\n## Tailoring the Product Suite to Client Needs\nFrom the beginning of EliseAI’s history, client feedback has been a primary driver of our product strategy. Staying close to our client’s business through deep relationships built by our CSMs ensures that EliseAI’s growth and partnerships with property management teams allow the product suite to evolve and adapt to real-world challenges, rather than ideas about what property managers “should” need. The growth of the platform across diverse operational needs and functions, spanning from leasing to collections to resident services, ensures that every part of the conventional property management workflow will be impacted by AI. It’s EliseAI’s focus on leveraging the relationships of our Customer Success team that has helped us be the only multifamily AI vendor automating every part of the resident lifecycle, from [initial inquiry](https://www.eliseai.com/resources/leasingai) to [renewal](https://www.eliseai.com/resources/renewals) to move-out.\n\n## Leveraging The EliseAI Customer Success Advantage\nOur commitment to proactive support, client-focused innovation, and collaborative growth is a key differentiator for EliseAI. While there are legacy providers and other PropTech startups building valuable products for the property management space, no other vendor combines EliseAI’s level of cutting edge technological expertise with best-in-class support. As clearly evidenced by the property management leaders who highlighted their experiences with EliseAI’s CS team, this commitment to differentiated service has helped operators quickly realize value from AI and [automation](https://www.eliseai.com/blog/how-eliseai-is-helping-multifamily-managers-rethink-operations-with-automation) while improving the [experiences residents and prospects](https://www.eliseai.com/blog/5-ways-ai-improves-the-modern-renting-experience) have at their communities.
