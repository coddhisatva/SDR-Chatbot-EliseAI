    "main_content": "# Centralization Checklist: 10 Steps to Prep Your SFR Portfolio for a Centralized Model\n\nUnlike the traditional multifamily rental property management setup, with its heavy reliance on on-site personnel based out of the communities they manage, the single family rental property management model is well suited to centralized operations due to the spread out nature of many portfolios. But don’t let that trick you into thinking that centralizing the property management operations for your single family rental portfolio is going to be easy. As is the case with overarching procedural shifts for any business, there’s going to be a lot of change management best practices you’re going to have to put into place to help staff and residents alike get comfortable with a new way of operating.\n\nWith that in mind, we asked some of our largest single family rental customers to provide their insights into how to overcome the obstacles associated with centralization. Here are ten key steps they recommend taking in preparation for increased centralization to set your organization up for success.\n\n### 1. Create a roadmap and timeline for your centralization efforts\nBuilding a comprehensive roadmap for your centralization efforts, including start and end dates for different stages of the process, is key to ensuring everyone involved in the project is able to stay on track and on the same page. It helps keep teams accountable and ensures they’re able to operate on manageable timelines. Plus, building an easy to follow roadmap broken down by phases also enables you to undergo the change gradually and in measured steps, making it easier to draw actionable conclusions from the process.\n\n### 2. Get buy-in from key stakeholders and (for third party managers) ownership group\nYou can be dead set on revamping the existing structure of your property management operations to a more centralized model, but if your key stakeholders don’t believe in the project and your ownership groups are opposed to centralizing you’re going to have a very difficult time making any substantive changes to your operations.\n\n### 3. Define the scope of work for different teams involved in centralization\nOne of the key benefits of centralization is that teams can focus on the specialized tasks that they’re best suited to handling as opposed to more general responsibilities. In order to ensure each team has a clear picture of what they’re in charge of handling, it’s pivotal to document clearly which role—onsite or centralized—is in charge of what during the centralization process.\n\n### 4. Build a centralization committee to keep the project on track\nAs centralization requires collaboration between multiple teams spread across a variety of locations, it’s crucial to establish a dedicated committee tasked with ensuring continued alignment during the process.\n\n### 5. Define uniform talking points to be shared with department leaders\nWhenever an organization undergoes a large procedural change it’s only natural that team members will have a ton of questions about the what and the why behind the process. It’s pivotal that you ensure consistent messaging about centralization on a department by department basis.\n\n### 6. Acknowledge and address the changes to come\nAs long as we’re on the subject of talking points, it’s important to be transparent and honest about the growing pains that your organization might undergo as you centralize your property management operations.\n\n### 7. Define centralization project prioritizations relative to other org initiatives\nIn a perfect world, centralization could be your organization’s one and only key strategic priority. But realistically, there’s going to be a wide variety of initiatives and projects going on across the organization.\n\n### 8. Create new centralized job descriptions\nThe roles and responsibilities of your team will inevitably change as your organization’s structure changes, so it’s crucial that you adapt your job descriptions to more accurately describe the work your team members are doing.\n\n### 9. Build a pilot set of communities to help test and iterate\nSelecting a small group of pilot communities to start your centralization efforts is an important first step, because deploying new technology and processes at scale is going to be incredibly difficult without having done it on a limited basis first.\n\n### 10. Invest in the right technology\nIt’s crucial to consider whether the tools you have in place are going to enable or hinder a transition to a centralized property management services model. For example, if your prospect data lives in one system and your resident data lives in another system it could create a disconnect that results in leads falling through the cracks or resident requests going unanswered.\n\nWhen it comes to the single family rental sector, it takes a combination of both procedural and technological changes to effectively centralize your property management operations. Following the steps our customers shared with us above can go a long way towards preparing your team for the transition."
