    "main_content": "# How EliseAI Makes Healthcare More Accessible Around the U.S.\n\nIf you’ve called to schedule a doctor’s appointment recently, you have felt the pain of being stuck on hold and having to navigate complex phone trees. Health professionals want to spend their time providing in person support to their patients - not on the phone.\n\nEliseAI is automating non-clinical tasks in healthcare so that doctors and patients don’t need to make tradeoffs. In partnership with ElevenLabs, EliseAI has successfully deployed AI voice agents across multiple healthcare verticals, lowering barriers to care across the U.S. EliseAI's assistants can reliably conduct domain-specific conversations with technical expertise - from appointment scheduling to billing and payment processing.\n\n![Example Scheduling Call with EliseAI](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63cc1eef179b05d927065991/67a52b6ce916066daae9b707_Blog-Image1-Final%20(1).png)\n\n## The Power of Natural Conversation\n\nOne of the biggest concerns EliseAI heard when getting started was that AI voices would not sound natural and patients would reject AI scheduling. They came to us in search of natural human-like voices that people would want to talk to. The end result is a system so natural that only 15% of callers realize they're interacting with an AI agent. And of those who do realize, 95% continue through with the call, satisfied that they are able to get 24/7 immediate access to support.\n\n## Multilingual Support for Diverse Communities\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of EliseAI's implementation has been in making healthcare more accessible to non-English speakers, particularly in the Southern United States. Spanish speakers who previously struggled to make appointments can now do so in their native language. EliseAI currently has agents in English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Hindi, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, Dutch, Turkish, Swedish, Indonesian, Filipino, Japanese, Ukrainian, Greek, Czech, Bulgarian, and Classic Arabic with plans to expand to 10 other languages.\n\nThe implementation of EliseAI's voice agents, powered by ElevenLabs, has led to remarkable improvements in enhancing healthcare administration and efficiency:\n\n- 66% reduction in cost per call\n- 88% of calls fully handled by AI agents\n\nAnd overall has significantly improved patient outcomes and increased accessibility in healthcare, specifically in rural areas while maintaining security and reliability in the process.\n\n## Getting Started with EliseAI at Your Practice\n\nAs EliseAI continues to refine its technology and expand its reach, the potential for AI-driven improvements in healthcare administration is boundless. With ElevenLabs' voice technology at its core, EliseAI is not just streamlining processes – it's reshaping the future of healthcare communication, creating a more patient-centric ecosystem.
