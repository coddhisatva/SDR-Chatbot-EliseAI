    "main_content": "# Why Investing in EliseAI is More Cost-Effective Than You Think\n\nIn an industry where every dollar counts, it's natural to evaluate the cost of new technology carefully. At first glance, EliseAI may seem more expensive than other AI solutions on the market. However, our pricing reflects the advanced, highly customizable, and human-like AI experience we provide—one that goes beyond simple automation to deliver measurable business impact.\n\n## The True Cost of Piecing Together Point Solutions\n\nMany property management teams try to solve operational inefficiencies by layering multiple point solutions. They invest in separate tools for mass texting, chatbots, email communications, and call centers. However, this approach quickly becomes cost-prohibitive and inefficient for teams.\n\nTake [Juniper Investment Group](https://www.eliseai.com/resources/juniper-investment-group), for example. Before EliseAI, they were using three separate platforms for resident communication: a mass texting service, a first-response chatbot, and a call answering service. By consolidating these solutions into EliseAI, they reduced their technology spend by $1 per unit per month, while improving response times and automation efficiency.\n\nBy eliminating four separate solutions—an answering service, multimedia messaging software, experience management platform, and VoIP provider—the [Scion Group](https://www.eliseai.com/resources/how-the-scion-group-reinvented-their-leasing-process-with-conversational-ai) saved over **$500,000 per year**. \n\nRather than paying for multiple disconnected tools, EliseAI streamlines leasing, renewals, maintenance, and delinquencies—all in [one AI-powered platform](https://www.eliseai.com/gated-reducing-tech-stack).\n\n![Streamlined Solutions](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63cc1eef179b05d927065991/67d1c41607a0195084c66631_Blog-Image3-Final.png)\n\n## Seamless Integration & Continuous Innovation\n\nSince 2017, [EliseAI has raised $140M in funding](https://www.eliseai.com/blog/eliseai-world-leader-in-ai-enabled-solutions-for-housing-raises-75-million-series-d-round-valuing-company-in-excess-of-1-billion) to deliver best-in-class AI solutions tailored specifically for housing. Our advanced platform addresses persistent industry challenges by streamlining workflows, empowering operators, and consolidating essential AI functionalities into a single centralized solution. Developed in close collaboration with housing operators, our technology eliminates complexity, integrates with most property management systems (PMS) and customer management systems (CMS), and enables property teams to focus on delivering exceptional service.\n\nEliseAI supports communication across text, email, phone, and web chat, providing seamless accessibility with written interactions available in 51 languages and voice capabilities in 7 languages.\n\nAdditionally, EliseAI customizes communications to meet the unique requirements of various asset types, including conventional housing, student housing, affordable communities, lease-ups, and single-family rentals.\n\n![Integration and Innovation](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63cc1eef179b05d927065991/67d1c4055b13de8f6d3de8d6_Blog-Image2-Final.png)\n\n## ROI That Speaks for Itself\n\nCost is only one part of the equation—return on investment is what truly matters. EliseAI customers typically see a **5-10x ROI**, a number that initially seems high but is backed by real data.\n\nEliseAI's partnership with [The Scion Group](https://www.eliseai.com/resources/how-the-scion-group-reinvented-their-leasing-process-with-conversational-ai) resulted in approximately $1.3M in cost savings by replacing their call center operations with VoiceAI, streamlining communications, and significantly improving operational efficiency.\n\nBy implementing EliseAI’s conversational AI, [Juniper Investment Group](https://www.eliseai.com/resources/juniper-investment-group) improved leasing, collections, and maintenance operations, delivering ~$15 per unit/month ROI and convincing leadership to fully embrace automation-driven property management.\n\nTo help you evaluate the impact for your business, we conduct a personalized ROI analysis. This analysis details:\n- The cost savings from reducing inefficiencies and consolidating technology\n- The revenue increase from improved lead capture and higher conversion rates\n- The time saved for your team, allowing them to focus on higher-value tasks\n\n![Cost Savings and ROI](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63cc1eef179b05d927065991/67d1c426f23c66665ea5e1eb_Blog-Image4-Final.png)\n\n## A World-Class Customer Success Team to Maximize Your ROI\n\nInvesting in technology is about more than just the product—it’s about the partnership and support that come with it.
